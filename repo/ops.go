// This file holds the git operations that *change* a repo (pull/push/commit) or stream
// their output to a UI, as opposed to repo.go's read-only probes. They exist so the
// routine half of working a checkout — see what changed, pull, commit, push — can happen
// without leaving the app. They are deliberately not a git client: anything needing a
// decision (a diverged branch, a conflict, a rebase) fails and leaves the repo untouched
// for the user to sort out in a real terminal.

// GitStream runs a git command in dir, relaying its output to report one line at a time as
// it arrives, and returns a non-nil error when git exits non-zero (with git's own last
// words folded in, since that's the part worth reading). stdout and stderr are interleaved
// the way a terminal would show them — git writes progress and errors to stderr, and a
// caller streaming to a log wants both. ctx cancellation kills the subprocess, which is how
// a TUI's task-abort works.

// GitStatus streams the working tree's state: `status -sb`, the short form with a branch

// GitPull fast-forwards the checkout to its upstream. --ff-only is the whole point: when
// the branch has diverged (local commits *and* new upstream ones) git aborts and changes
// nothing, rather than starting a merge that could leave conflict markers in the working
// tree — or block on an editor — with the user still inside a TUI. Reconciling a divergence
// is a decision, so it belongs in a terminal.

// where the branch lives, not a routine push.

// GitCommit commits the working tree with message. stageAll decides what "all" means — the
// distinction the commit form makes the user choose, because git's own answer is a trap:
//
//   - false: `commit -a` stages modifications and deletions to *tracked* files. A file you
//     just created is untracked, so it is NOT committed.
//   - true: `add -A` first, so new files are included too.
//
// The message is passed as an exec argument, never through a shell, so quotes, newlines,
// and `$` in it need no escaping.

// lineWriter turns a subprocess's byte stream into whole lines for a Reporter. git delimits

// arrive as one unreadable line. It keeps the last line reported so a failing command can
// quote git's parting words in its error.
